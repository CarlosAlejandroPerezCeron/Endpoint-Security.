# Endpoint-Security.
This project seeks to protect the organization's endpoint equipment from cyber threats and, additionally, perform vulnerability analysis on an ongoing basis.

To do this, we will use:

1. CrowdStrike Falcon (SaaS/Commercial):

Offers real-time protection against malware, ransomware, and other threats.
Includes EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) capabilities.
Integrates with the CrowdStrike cloud for continuous analysis.
Vulnerability Scanning Tools (Open Source):

OpenVAS (Greenbone Community Edition): Open source solution for scanning vulnerabilities on servers and endpoints.
Alternatives: Nessus Essentials (limited free version), Nmap (for port and service identification).
Note: CrowdStrike is not a free solution. Its implementation requires licenses or a trial period. However, we can complement the commercial component with free vulnerability scanning tools to create a hybrid ecosystem.
