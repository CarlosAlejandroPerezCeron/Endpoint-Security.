To complement endpoint protection with vulnerability scanning, we will deploy OpenVAS on an Ubuntu server.

Installing Dependencies

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wget gnupg
Installing Greenbone Community Edition

Add the official repository (example for Ubuntu 20.04):
bash
Copy code
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mrazavi/gvm
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gvm
This will install the Greenbone components, including openvas.
Initializing the Vulnerability Database

bash
Copy code
sudo gvm-setup
This command may take several minutes (or longer) depending on your internet connection.

Starting Services

bash
Copy code
sudo gvm-start
At the end of the process, you will see a URL and credentials to access the Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA).

Accessing the Web Interface (GSA)

Go to https://<SERVER-IP>:9392/.
Log in with the username and password generated when you finished the setup.
Creating and Running Scans

Within the GSA, go to Scans > Tasks and create a new task.
Select the range of IP addresses or hostnames you want to scan (for example, endpoints with CrowdStrike installed).
Start the scan and review the results.
